## Overview  
The challenge was to determine the **“best ski resort option.”**  
Instead of following the usual one-size-fits-all approach, we developed a full **data science pipeline** that delivers **personalized, data-driven recommendations** tailored to each user’s preferences.

**Highlight:** We broke from the conventional “single best option” model by blending **forecasting + vectorized multi-criteria comparison + user-driven weighting** — enabling **future-oriented, personalized decisions.**

## Our Approach (in a nutshell)  
0. **External data collection** – gathered additional datasets (accommodation, pricing, facilities) via online research and pipelines.  
1. **Data preprocessing** – cleaned and structured **resort, weather, and visitation data** for analysis.  
2. **Forecasting (ML)** – predicted **2026 seasonal variables** (snowfall, temperature, visitors, etc.) using machine learning models.  
3. **Vector-based comparison (40+ features)** – represented each resort as a **feature vector** and applied **mathematical methods** (weighted scoring, distance metrics) for ranking.  
4. **Adaptive weighting system** – combined **domain research** with **user-defined preferences** (budget, distance, skill level, etc.) to generate **customized rankings.**  
5. **Deployment** – delivered the insights via a clean, interactive **web app** for real-time recommendations.
